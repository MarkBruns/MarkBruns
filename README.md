Sure, I think the action in the [topic of agentic AI on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/agentic-ai) is fun to explore and justifiably hot, but I continue to be curious about things like:

-  The whole [Python](https://github.com/topics/python) [ecosystem](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-performance/libraries/ecosystem) or [Jupyter](https://github.com/topics/jupyter) [ecosystem for scaling science](https://developmentseed.org/scaling_science/docs/Use_of_notebooks.html) will never get old because of things like [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but I am also intrigued by developments like [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), including [its business/license model](https://positron.posit.co/licensing.html) using [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme). Generally everything in the polyglot notebook world is going to be interesting to me, particularly when I see what's going on in [R](https://github.com/topics/r) or the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) with [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.tidymodels.org/) and the [tidychatmodels](https://tidychatmodels.albert-rapp.de/) wrapper, for around the API of different chatbots to provide a unified interface to communicate with them. 

- Experimental design frameworks and the efficient structure of research programs, especially in microbiomes but also single cells. My thinking is probably driven by causal or [Integrated Inference](https://integrated-inferences.github.io/book/). I am, of course, curious about different topics on different pre-print Rxiv servers, but when I am looking for context, I know use AI quite a bit, but I have traditionally gravitated toward open access texts like [Single-Cell Best Practices](https://sc-best-practices.org). I believe that the texts give the public ways to follow along and participate on their own machines in a hands-on fashion, with developments in science and computational chemistry or biology and develop a passing familiarity with tools like [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) and the [tidychatmodels](https://tidychatmodels.albert-rapp.de/) wrapper for AI / LLM

- Everything about [open source community](https://github.blog/tag/open-source-community/) and advancing the cause of open sourcists is going to continue to be interesting to me, but maybe especially for [maintainers](https://github.blog/tag/maintainers/) and interaction/career development ideas [Github Profile README examples](https://github.com/topics/github-profile-readme), especially abhisheknaiidu's [curated AWESOME list](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme), focusing mostly on simple pages maybe with relevant embeddable metrics or status, eg [Lowlighter Metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) or [Theis Lab GH-Dashboard](https://github.com/theislab/gh-dashboard), but probably leaning toward something like [simonw's Github Profile README](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme/).
