Of course, I think the action on [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface) [Models](https://huggingface.co/models) and the [topic of agentic AI on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/agentic-ai) is compelling and justifiably ***hot***, but I continue to be curious about things like:

-  The whole [Python](https://github.com/topics/python) [ecosystem](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-performance/libraries/ecosystem) or [Jupyter](https://github.com/topics/jupyter) [ecosystem for scaling science](https://developmentseed.org/scaling_science/docs/Use_of_notebooks.html) will never get old because of things like [annotated data](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/news.html) for analyzing single-cell gene expression data, but I am also intrigued by open source developments like [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), including [its business/license model](https://positron.posit.co/licensing.html) using [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme). Generally everything in the polyglot notebook world is going to be interesting to me, particularly when I see what's going on in [R](https://github.com/topics/r) or the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) with [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.tidymodels.org/) and the [tidychatmodels](https://tidychatmodels.albert-rapp.de/) wrapper, for around the API of different chatbots to provide a unified interface to communicate with them. 

- Experimental design frameworks and the efficient structure of research programs, especially techniques that might work across microbiomes but also single cells. My thinking is probably driven by [multi-modal root cause analysis](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/2c13a7927260bfa6272c4b6d02c6f4841150e0b7/Multi%20modal-Causal-Structure-Learning-and-Root-Cause-Analysis/graph) or some form of agnostic statistics, let's say 'bayesian' or 'causal' or [Integrated Inference](https://integrated-inferences.github.io/book/) *what did we implicitly assume about our data?* OR, if we're gathering data, *what do hope to measure and how will our metrology change what we're measuring?*. I am, of course, terribly curious about different topics on [different pre-print servers](https://open-access.network/en/information/publishing/preprints#c10126) like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)  [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [SocArXiv](https://socopen.org/), [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/), [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/), [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/public-dashboard) or [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_preprint_repositories), but when I am looking for *context*, I now use AI with RAG or [embeddings to capture semantic meaning and context through numerical representations of data](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-embedding-text-model-now-available-gemini-api/) to get a broader, bigger picture ***first*** of what to dive deeper into, but I have traditionally gravitated toward open access texts like [Single-Cell Best Practices](https://sc-best-practices.org). I believe that the texts still provide value and give interested, knowledgeable members of the public ways to follow along and participate on their own machines in a hands-on fashion, with developments in science and computational chemistry or biology and develop a passing familiarity with tools like [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) and the [tidychatmodels](https://tidychatmodels.albert-rapp.de/) wrapper for AI / LLM

- Everything about [open source community](https://github.blog/tag/open-source-community/) and advancing the cause of open sourcists is going to continue to be interesting to me, but maybe especially for [maintainers](https://github.blog/tag/maintainers/) and interaction/career development ideas [Github Profile README examples](https://github.com/topics/github-profile-readme) and [abhisheknaiidu's curated AWESOME list of clever READMEs](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme), focusing mostly on simple pages maybe with relevant embeddable metrics or status, eg [Lowlighter Metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) or [Theis Lab GH-Dashboard](https://github.com/theislab/gh-dashboard), but probably leaning toward something like [simonw's Github Profile README](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme/).

So ... just for fun ... let's say that I wanted to [*replit*](https://replit.com/@markbruns/SkillMastery) these paragraphs into a study plan to *program me.*
