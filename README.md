# Current Curiosities

- [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), including [business/license model](https://positron.posit.co/licensing.html) using [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme) ... and generally everything in R, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.tidymodels.org/) and the [tidychatmodels](https://tidychatmodels.albert-rapp.de/) wrapper around the API of different chatbots and provides a unified interface to communicate with them. 

- [Single-Cell Best Practices](https://sc-best-practices.org) and ways to follow along, in a local-ish fashion, with science and computational biology, with tools like [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) and the [tidychatmodels](https://tidychatmodels.albert-rapp.de/) wrapper

- Experimental design frameworks and the efficient structure of research programs, especially in microbiomes, but driven by causal inference -- thus, my interest in open access texts like [Integrated Inferences](https://integrated-inferences.github.io/book/)

- The [full Github Topic search of Github Profile README examples](https://github.com/topics/github-profile-readme), especially abhisheknaiidu's [curated AWESOME list](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme), focusing mostly on simple pages maybe with embeddable metrics, eg [Lowlighter Metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) or [Theis Lab GH-Dashboard](https://github.com/theislab/gh-dashboard), but probably leaning toward something like [simonw's Github Profile README](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme/).
