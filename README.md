# My current curiosities ... 

## 1. Regenerative AI Knowledge Systems

*AI-enhanced learning frameworks that integrate multidisciplinary knowledge while supporting ethical stewardship*

[Regenerative AI Knowledge Systems](https://x.com/i/grok/share/PBAVsW0EoxhrjhDkKILES0Psc) represent the intersection of agentic AI assistants and knowledge engineering that specifically supports multidisciplinary careers spanning technology, economics, and environmental stewardship. This field explores how AI can help professionals not just organize information, but actively generate connections between disparate fields like engineering, investment strategy, and conservation practices. The focus is on creating systems that enhance human expertise rather than replace it, while ensuring the knowledge gained serves regenerative purposes across both natural and economic ecosystems. This approach allows professionals to leverage technology for more holistic decision-making that respects both technological innovation and ecological wisdom.

## 2. Health-Optimized Creativity

*Age-adaptive health and fitness protocols designed to enhance cognitive performance and creative output*

[Health-Optimized Creativity](https://x.com/i/grok/share/GR6tPxqFSUTyGmXY4pkIokE2Q) is not the same as Longevity-Optimized Creativity although they explore the same cutting-edge approaches to physical and mental fitness specifically tailored for experienced professionals in their 60s and beyond. This field is very competitive; lots of people are out there attempting to integrate the latest research in exercise physiology, nutrition, and cognitive science to design lifestyle protocols that do not just extend lifespan but maximize creative and productive capacity throughout later life. The focus is on identifying the unique advantages of mature cognition and developing practices that leverage these strengths while addressing age-specific challenges. By optimizing physical health to support mental performance, this approach creates a virtuous cycle where productivity and creativity continue to flourish with age.

## 3. Transformative Discipleship Technology

*Faith-aligned personal development integrating spiritual practice with modern knowledge systems*

[Transformative Discipleship Technology](https://x.com/i/grok/share/jDQ6x3QepOu7Yc2tqtwJ0Mnia), and all of the AI-firepower and other advances of our modern age, represents a revolutionary approach to Christian discipleship that recognizes spiritual growth as a form of perfecting fitness for purpose for SERVE FIRST leadership. There are incredible amounts of supporting resources in this area, which is to be expected, given the primacy that this topic has had in humankind since the very beginnings of the beginnings of passed-down knowledge and cultural values. This field integrates ancient Classical texts and scholarship with traditional spiritual disciplines with evidence-based approaches to behavior change, cognitive restructuring, and habit formation. It views sin not merely as moral failure but as a productivity-limiting, self-destructing design flaw that reduces human flourishing and effectiveness in fulfilling divine purpose. By applying modern understanding of psychology, neuroscience, and technology to age-old spiritual challenges, this approach creates practical pathways to become more Christ-like that are measurable, sustainable, and deeply integrated with health and professional development practices.

# So That We May BETTER Train Ourselves

Sure, trending topics have ways of injecting themselves into my life ... but I have to bring things back to my main three areas of interest. My three current curiosities about knowledge engineering and improvement in health-driven creativity are really just about one thing: so that I might be a better disciple of Christ are about me taking greater responsibility for developing  better open source ways *to program me ... so that we may BETTER train ourselves.*
